This was live data project, therefore, I had to anonymizing every personal informations in it.
All the anonymizing was done by Faker package.
Data was driven by Hotjar.

Main Question of the project was,
1. How many people visit the platform on average every week, every month?

2. How much time do they spend on the platform?

3. Which notebooks are the most popular and which are the least popular?

4. Are users from the past cohort still returning to use the platform?

5. Can we figure out which user from the last cohort has not used the platform at all?
